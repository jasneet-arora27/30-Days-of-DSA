## 📝 Review Plan:

- **1. Revisit Challenging Problems:**

  - Let’s go back to the problems that we found hard over the past 13 days.
  - We can break them down again and understand why they were challenging.

- **2. Time Your Solutions:**

  - We should practice solving previously solved problems within a time limit to improve our speed and confidence.

- **3. Solidify Concepts:**

  - Let’s review our notes, and revisit tricky concepts like tree traversal, stack/queue operations, and hash functions.
  - We need to ensure we’re comfortable with both basic and advanced versions of each data structure.

- **4. Visualize & Analyze:**

  - For each data structure, we can create visual diagrams or examples to better understand how they operate.

## 🚀 Next Steps:

- Relax and Reflect: Take a moment to feel good about your progress! 🎉
- Revise: Focus on revising areas where you feel less confident.
- Prepare for Week 3: Get ready to dive deeper into Graphs and more advanced Data Structures next week!

## 🔔 Remember:

- Consistency is key! 🚀
- Let’s not rush; we should focus on understanding instead of memorizing.

Good luck with the review today! We're making great progress—let’s keep the momentum going! 💪🔥
